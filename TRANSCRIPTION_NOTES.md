# TikTok Transcription Implementation Notes

## Current Status: CORS Blocked - Needs Server-Side Solution

### Error Analysis (from testing):
```
TikToker: Expanded URL: https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8Sj4Gby/
TikToker: Attempting audio extraction for: https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8Sj4Gby/

ERROR: Access to audio at 'https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8Sj4Gby/' from origin 'app://obsidian.md' 
has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

GET https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8Sj4Gby/ net::ERR_FAILED 301 (Moved Permanently)
```

### Root Issue:
- **Browser-based audio extraction CANNOT work** with TikTok URLs
- CORS policy prevents direct access from Obsidian app
- Short URLs redirect with 301, but we can't follow redirects for media access
- TikTok actively blocks direct audio/video access

### What We Implemented (working on transcription branch):
✅ Vosk-browser integration (50MB model download)  
✅ Asynchronous transcription with live status updates  
✅ Proper error handling and logging  
✅ Audio buffer creation and processing  
✅ Note updating system with placeholders  

### Next Steps for Transcription (future work):
1. **Server-side audio extraction required**:
   - Use `yt-dlp` or `youtube-dl` on a server
   - Extract audio to temporary file
   - Process through Vosk locally
   
2. **Alternative approaches**:
   - Electron app integration (not browser-limited)
   - Local server that handles audio extraction
   - Pre-download audio files for processing

3. **Architecture that would work**:
   ```
   TikTok URL → Local Server (yt-dlp) → Audio File → Vosk → Transcription
   ```

### Current Implementation Status:
- **Framework**: 100% complete and working
- **Vosk Integration**: Fully functional (tested with dummy audio)
- **Status Tracking**: Live updates working
- **Audio Extraction**: Blocked by CORS (expected)

### Files Modified for Transcription:
- `main.ts`: Added Vosk integration, async transcription, status tracking
- `package.json`: Added vosk-browser dependency
- All changes are on `transcription` branch

### Testing Results:
- Plugin correctly identifies the CORS issue
- Shows detailed error messages
- Status updates work properly
- Vosk model download would work if audio was available
- Framework is solid for future server-side implementation

**Conclusion**: Browser-based direct TikTok audio extraction is impossible due to security restrictions. Future implementation needs server-side audio extraction component.
